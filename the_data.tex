\section{The Data}
In order to answer our research question, we had to examine different gaming communities' attitudes towards certain groups and therefore we chose games that we believe cover a broad demographic spectrum of participants.
The games we chose to focus on are as follows: 
% \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
%     \item \textbf{\emph{Fortnite}} the leading game of the battle royale genre which is considered to have a younger community.
    
%     \item  \textbf{\emph{PUBG}} a game of the same genre as \emph{Fortnite} but holds a more mature crowd.
    
%     \item \textbf{\emph{Fifa}} one of the most popular and successful soccer games.
    
%     \item  \textbf{\emph{Overwatch}} a team oriented shooter.
    
%     \item  \textbf{\emph{World of Warcraft}} the leading game of the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (\emph{MMORPG}).
    
%     \item  \textbf{\emph{Guild Wars2}} another MMORPG.
    
%     \item  \textbf{\emph{Dota 2}} a Multiplayer Online Brawl Arena (\emph{MOBA}) successor to the first game in the genre.
    
%     \item \textbf{\emph{League of Legends}} another MOBA game. considered to have a younger community in it's genre.
    
%     \item \textbf{\emph{Heroes of the Storm}} another MOBA game.
    
%     \item \textbf{\emph{Hearthstone}} a digital collectible card game.
    
%     \item \textbf{\emph{Bloodstained}} a game which was released during the period we collected data.
    
    
%     \item \textbf{\emph{The Sims}} a life simulation game which is considered to have a female majority of players.

\subsection{Data Collection}
In order to collect as much data as we can, we chose the two most liberal platforms in regards to sharing their data - \href{http://www.twitter.com}{Twitter} and \href{http://www.reddit.com}{Reddit}. Gathering the data included listening to ongoing Twitter stream for a month and scraping all the available and relevant data from Reddit.

\subsubsection{Twitter Listener}
We used the library \href{https://pypi.org/project/tweet-preprocessor/}{tweet-preprocessor} in order to retrieve the tweets that will provide us with only the relevant data. Those that mention the games we are interested in following or that are originating from profiles of interest like known games streamers and game profile pages.


\subsubsection{Reddit Scraper}
Reddit allows scraping data using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) which granted us the opportunity to query data of our choice after concluding a manual search to choose the relevant subreddits. We found at least two subreddits per game and collected their data - topics, comments and replies, using PRAW.


\subsection{Data Cleaning}
Data collected from social networks tends to be noisy and incoherent - filled with special characters, URLs and emojis.
We wanted to apply the use of NLP based technologies that utilize clean and coherent data that resembles the natural use of language. To achieve that, we first chose to use only data in the English language, then we removed emojis, emoticons, URLs, mentions, reserved twitter words(retweets) and all the characters excluded from the Roman alphabet. We also made sure to remove all the duplicate posts we got from retweets. Further more, we removed stop words in order to train embedding models and bag of words. 
The amount of data before cleaning can be observed in the columns "\#Posts from Twitter/Reddit" of Table \ref{tab:label} and statistics after data cleaning in "\#Posts combined" and "\#Words in data".

Following the clean-up we examined the remaining data and concluded that for 3 out of 13 games (Guild Wars 2, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm) it was insufficient so we decided to discard those from our research.
