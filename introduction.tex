\section{Introduction}
The online gaming community always had its fair share of scandals and controversies.
One main example of that is \textbf{\emph{\#GamerGate}}, which started as an harassment campaign against certain women in the gaming industry and then backfired as the hash-tag was used against the entire online gaming community which was accused of being sexist, racist and violent. These events caused concerns regarding verbal violence in gaming communities and raised the following  research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are these communities sexist?
    \item Are these communities racist?
    \item What is their relation to politics and Trump?
\end{itemize}  

In order to answer these questions objectively and in an empirical manner, we collected data from Twitter and Reddit. The data collected per game and then analyzed for each game separately using NLP models. We evaluated the different gaming communities' linguistic properties in respect to our research question in order to make a comparison for each communities' sexism, racism and Trump hate. To achieve that, we invented our novel \textbf{\emph{Negativity Evaluation Metric (NEM)}}. Using our method we discovered that the entire gaming communities are in-fact engaging in a sexist and racist debates, and some are more politically affiliated than others.
