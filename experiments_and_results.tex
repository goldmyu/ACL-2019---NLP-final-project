For each community, we calculated the percentage of positive, neutral, and negative posts from all community posts, these results can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:Polarity} below. It can be seen that in all communities most posts are extreme, positive or negative and less neutral.
Additionally, we calculate the positive and negative polarity values average for every community, these results can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:PolarityAverage}.
