\section{Previous Work}
There have been previous works done in the field of communities analysis and bias identification in the online realm using NLP technologies, for example, at their work \cite{wang2019ynu} are trying to detected hate speech against women and minority groups by analyzing twitter data as well. In their work \cite{traud2011comparing} are trying to compare distinct communities using graphical analysis methods, their area of interest are social networks of college student from different universities.

Another very relevant work we reviewed was done by \cite{patil2012modeling} which tried to model destructive group dynamics in Online Gaming Communities, they also chose to address the community of the game \emph{World of Warcraft} which we analyzed as well. Their work examined how changes in the social dynamics like a departure of a member from a guild (small in-game community) will effect the entire community.

In our work we will try and do a similar analysis of online communities using our own novel metric to try and quantify in a measurable and comparable way the difference between the communities.
